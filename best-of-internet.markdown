### Advice for students

* If you are in a rush to <strike>learn</strike> master programming, confused about which programming language to learn, which IDE/OS to use or which books to refer, read Peter Norvig's [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html). [Peter Norvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig) is Director of Research at Google.

* If you want to start contributing to open source projects or do an internship and are worried about how to get it going, Shakthi Kannan comes to rescue with his epic article-esque presentation [i want 2 do project tell me wat 2 do](http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/i-want-2-do-project-tell-me-wat-2-do.pdf). He also published this presentation as [a book with the same name](http://www.amazon.in/Want-Project-Tell-Wat-do/dp/9351967832/) but I could not find spare time to read it (hopefully, someday soon). Shakthi Kannan has worked in Senior Software Engineer roles at System Insights, RedHat etc.

### Software Engineering
* Tom Preston-Werner (cofounder of Github) wrote [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). These are simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented.
* [The Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/) is a triangulation on ideal practices for software-as-a-service apps development, paying particular attention to the dynamics of the organic growth of an app over time, the dynamics of collaboration between developers working on the appâ€™s codebase, and avoiding the cost of software erosion.
