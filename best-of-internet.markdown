## Stuff I recommend on Internet

### Advice for students

* If you are confused about which programming language to learn, which IDE/OS to use and which books to refer, read Norvig's [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html). [Peter Norvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig) is Director of Research at Google.

* If you want to start contributing to open source projects or do an internship and are worried about how to get it going, Shakthi Kannan comes to rescue with his epic article-esque presentation [i want 2 do project tell me wat 2 do](http://www.shakthimaan.com/downloads/glv/presentations/i-want-2-do-project-tell-me-wat-2-do.pdf). He also published this presentation as [a book with the same name](http://www.amazon.in/Want-Project-Tell-Wat-do/dp/9351967832/) but I could not find spare time to read it (hopefully, someday soon). Shakthi Kannan has worked in Senior Software Engineer roles at System Insights, RedHat etc.
