## Job, Internship, Resume, Interviews

According to [this BusinessInsider article](http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-recruiters-look-at-during-the-6-seconds-they-spend-on-your-resume-2012-4), recruiters spend an average of "six seconds before they make the initial 'fit or no fit' decision" on candidates. This is why one needs to create his/her resume and prepare for job interviews with utmost care. Here are some of the resources I had collected over the time for the same:
