* [Quoting](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1248923) [Fred Brooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks): <blockquote>"Peopleware is the best book on software management to appear in the last twenty years. I require it in my Professional Practice course and recommend it to all who seek advice. First, it focuses on people, not processes or products; that is exactly right. Second, it is based on lots of real data and real experiences from many software development shops; that is rare. Third, DeMarco and Lister's writing is not only clear but captivating; that is most welcome.<br />
The deepest and most valuable treatments are those of flow and of team jelling. Don't let the colloquial language fool you: mastery and exploitation of these two concepts will radically improve your management style. Peopleware tells us why and how. <br />
Similarly, the prescriptions for teamicide are cogent and potent—guaranteed to work.<br />
Perhaps the feature that most distinguishes Peopleware is the provision of data from the Coding War Games and other broad consulting experience. These data provide unanswerable support for many of the assertions and recommendations."</blockquote>
* [Quoting](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1248923) [Barry Boehm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Boehm): <blockquote>"I've relied extensively on Tom DeMarco’s and Tim Lister’s Peopleware concepts, stories, pitfalls, and general wisdom about people when I’m teaching my masters’-level Software Management and Economics course and my Software Engineering team project course each year. They are just the right thing for dealing with the 150 computer science graduates who arrive each year having learned over four years of study to abstract people factors out of whatever they do with software. They know all about bin packing algorithms and approach software project staffing problems in the same way. Their bent toward abstraction fills their user interface diagrams and prototypes with users named U<sub>1</sub>, U<sub>2</sub>, U<sub>3</sub>, and U<sub>n</sub>. Left to themselves, many of them would go through their careers solving software project problems in the same way. And they would be suckers for each new abstract process or methodology that promised to solve the software productivity, quality, or predictability problem.
<br />What Tom and Tim have done with Peopleware is to provide students (and their instructors) with lively, well-chosen, experience-based, easy-to-remember examples of the bad things that happen to projects where people are treated as abstractions, objects, or interchangeable parts. They have balanced this with examples of the good things that happen to projects where people are treated with thoughtfulness and respect for their individual objectives and capabilities. With Peopleware, they have done a wonderful service for many software practitioners and for the software engineering profession at large."</blockquote>
* [Quoting](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1248923) [Harlan Mills](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Mills)' assessment of
the original edition: <blockquote>"DeMarco and Lister are masters of the sociology of systems and software development - must reading for every manager and technical leader."</blockquote>
* [Quoting](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1248923) [Linda Rising](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Rising): <blockquote>"My copy of the 1987 edition of Peopleware is embarrassingly tattered. I don't carry it with me because I don't want people to think I get all my good ideas from Tom and Tim! But it just might be true (along with the good ideas I get from Ed, Fred and Barry)! I believe that Peopleware documents "patterns" for the people-side of software. I say that for many reasons but the primary one is that when you read their book you think (on the one hand) well, this is so obvious, but (on the other-hand) why don't we *do* it? Just like a lot of the best patterns for any domain. Common sense is so uncommon. Now, of course, many of these ideas have become common or accepted, but at the time they were startling. We still don't do them. However, that's good for the consulting business and another edition!"</blockquote>
* [Quoting](http://www.dorsethouse.com/books/pw.html) [Edward Yourdon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Yourdon): <blockquote>"When the first edition appeared, I wrote a review that said "I strongly recommend that you buy one copy of Peopleware for yourself and another copy for your boss. If you are a boss, then buy one for everyone in your department, and buy one for your boss." The advice still holds 12 years later, and my recommendation is even more enthusiastic Ñ the new edition has 8 new chapters, covering such topics as competition, process improvement programs, "teamicide revisited," organizational learning, the concept of "human capital," a discussion of the "ultimate" management sin, and some excellent suggestions on how best to create a software development community."</blockquote>
[Quoting](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1248923) Ed Yourdon from another source: <blockquote>"When DeMarco and Lister wrote Peopleware 20 years ago, it was a bit of a shock for many in the IT profession, for they had been so focused on tools and technology and process that they had lost sight of the human element of software development. But nearly 20 years earlier, it was just as much of a shock for people in the industry when they read Gerald Weinberg's The Psychology of Computer Programming. And it may well be a shock to the current generation of IT techies who attend this ICSE session in 2007 that yes, people are still a key factor in software development!"</blockquote>
* [Jeff Atwood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood) has [cited this book frequently on his blog](http://www.google.com/search?q=site:www.codinghorror.com+peopleware). [Quoting](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/02/recommended-reading-for-developers.html) Jeff: <blockquote>"If you've ever seen the performance of an all-star sports team suffer due to poor coaching, you'll appreciate this book. It doesn't matter how many "coding superstars" you've got when none of them can talk to each other, or agree on anything. And it no developer, however talented, can work effectively when constantly being barraged with minor interruptions. Developers aren't known for their people skills, per se, but here's the ironic part: the success of your project may hinge on just that. If you have any legitimate aspirations to be a "Team Leader" in practice instead of in name only, you need to pick up a copy of this book.<br />
While this book is full of great, totally valid points, it also implies a level of employee control over the workplace that is pure fantasy at most companies. But at least you'll know when your work environment, or your team, are the real problem-- and more importantly, what to do about it."</blockquote>
* Quoting [Prof. Peter Norvig](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig) from different sources:<br />
	* Prof. Norvig [recommends](http://www.amazon.com/review/R2RJPYSARLKMD1/) reading books written by one of the coauthors of _Peopleware_: <blockquote>"... (to my mind) the two best author/consultants in the business, <b>Demarco</b> and Weinberg."</blockquote>
	* Prof. Norvig _again_ [recommends](http://www.amazon.com/review/R1SLGT2CUWBVAU) reading books written by one of the coauthors of _Peopleware_: <blockquote>"... But I think you'd be better off ... with <b>DeMarco</b>, Beck, or Fowler."</blockquote>
	* Prof. Norvig [recommends](http://norvig.com/yourdon.html) another book written by one of the coauthors of _Peopleware_: <blockquote>"<b>Tom DeMarco</b>'s _The Deadline_ is certainly the best novel about software project management ever written, and will likely remain so long into the future (even if another novel on software project management is ever published). I recommend it."</blockquote>
Tom DeMarco's _The Deadline_ is on my to-read list now!

* [Joel Spolsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Spolsky) has [cited this book frequently on his blog](http://www.google.com/search?q=site:http://www.joelonsoftware.com+peopleware). [Quoting](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/navlinks/fog0000000262.html) Joel: <blockquote>"As summer interns at Microsoft, my friends and I used to take "field trips" to the company supply room to stock up on school supplies. Among the floppy disks, mouse pads, and post-it notes was a stack of small paperback books, so I took one home to read. The book was Peopleware, by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister. This book was one of the most influential books I've ever read. The best way to describe it would be as an Anti-Dilbert Manifesto. Ever wonder why everybody at Microsoft gets their own office, with walls and a door that shuts? It's in there. Why do managers give so much leeway to their teams to get things done? That's in there too. Why are there so many jelled SWAT teams at Microsoft that are remarkably productive? Mainly because Bill Gates has built a company full of managers who read Peopleware. I can't recommend this book highly enough. It is the one thing every software manager needs to read... not just once, but once a year."</blockquote>

* [Quoting](http://www.dorsethouse.com/books/pw.html) [Steve McConnell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McConnell): <blockquote>"The original publication of Tom DeMarco and Timopthy Lister's Peopleware was a watershed event.... DeMarco and Lister for the first time presented a compelling case for elevating people-centered considerations from their common position as an afterthought to center stage....<br />
With this influential track record, the new revision of Peopleware is one of the few books I will buy sight unseen."</blockquote>

* [Quoting](http://www.dorsethouse.com/books/pw.html) [Rose Ann Giordano](http://www.forbes.com/profile/rose-giordano/): <blockquote>"challenges the modern myth that technology is the cornerstone of productivity. It makes you think about creating a culture that allows people to work (more) effectively."</blockquote>

* [Quoting](http://www.dorsethouse.com/books/pw.html) [Scott Ambler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Ambler): <blockquote>"The basic premise of this book is that the people issues involved with the development of software must be taken into account in order to be successfull and productive. This book is geared towards project managers, although in my opinion all developers should read it. The book provides excellent advice for building and managing teams that is based on real-world experience. It also provides intelligent insight into the design of people's work areas, including ergonomic issues and equipment-related advice. A must read for all project managers and most developers."</blockquote>

* [Quoting](http://www.dorsethouse.com/books/pw.html) [PC World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_World): <blockquote>"If you hire people for their brains, you can't treat them like modular components and expect an able, creative crew to emerge. That's the basic message in Peopleware.... fun to read because the authors illustrate their analyses and solutions with war stories drawn from their consulting experience. But this well-researched book is also persuasive because its advice is backed up by firm scholarship."</blockquote>

### My comments
TBD. I'm still reading this book. I'll post my comments/reviews as soon as I'm done. But as of now, I strongly recommend reading this book.
