Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover." <i><b>- Mark Twain</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>Live off your parents as long as possible. Your parents and grand parents worked very hard to get you and your family to this point. Do not deprive them of the pleasure of supporting you.
Take whole semesters off to travel overseas. Take jobs and internships that pay less money or no money. Investigate your passions on your parent's nickel. Or dime. Or quarter. Or dollar.
I took college-level classes... I never traveled or took time off because I thought it wouldn't prepare me for work. Frankly, I blew it.
You are going to work the rest of your lives, so don't be in a rush to start. Stretch out your college education. Now is the time to suck life into your lungs-before you have a mortgage, kids, and car payments.

### Hiring

<blockquote>"What the industry needs is a way to screen candidates by looking at their actual ability, not where they went to school or worked in the past." <i><b>- Ammon Bartram (for Triplebyte)</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>...Google had determined that GPA’s are worthless as a criteria for hiring, and test scores are worthless... we found that they don't predict anything... proportion of people without any college education at Google has increased over time - now as high as 14 percent on some teams.
The least important attribute they look for is "expertise"... If you take somebody who has high cognitive ability, is innately curious, willing to learn and has emergent leadership skills, and you hire them as an H.R. person or finance person, and they have no content knowledge... once in a while they will mess it up, he said, but once in a while they’ll also come up with an answer that is totally new. And there is huge value in that.
Talent can come in so many different forms and be built in so many nontraditional ways today, Hiring officers have to be alive to everyone - besides brand-name colleges. Because when you look at people who don't go to school and make their way in the world, those are exceptional human beings. And we should do everything we can to find those people.
Too many colleges don’t deliver on what they promise. You generate a ton of debt, you don’t learn the most useful things for your life. It’s [just] an extended adolescence. Beware. Your degree is not a proxy for your ability to do any job. The world only cares about - and pays off on - what you can do with what you know (and it doesn’t care how you learned it). <i><b>- Laszlo Bock</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is a mistake to hire huge numbers of people to get a complicated job done. Numbers will never compensate for talent in getting the right answer (two people who don’t know something are no better than one), will tend to slow down progress, and will make the task incredibly expensive." <i><b>- Elon Musk</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"So the first employee was our first engineer, I think we looked for him for four or five months. I probably looked through thousands of people and interviewed hundreds of people." <i><b>- Brian Chesky</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"There’s nothing wrong with staying small. You can do big things with a small team." <i><b>- Jason Fried</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Make something people want includes making a company that people want to work for." <i><b>- Sahil Lavingia</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Our job, the reason we have time to read blogs at work or go to conferences or write memos is that our organization believes that just maybe, we'll find and share a new idea, or maybe (continuing a run on sentence) we'll invent something important, find a resource or connect with a key customer in a way that matters." <i><b>- Seth Godin</b></i></blockquote>

### Design

<blockquote>"Don’t worry about people stealing your design work. Worry about the day they stop." <i><b>- Jeffrey Zeldman</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Why can't we take robotics at Carnegie Mellon, linear algebra at MIT, law at Stanford? And why can't we put 130 of those together and make it a degree?" <i><b>- Professor David Wiley</b></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Good code is its own best documentation. As you're about to add a comment, ask yourself, 'How can I improve the code so that this comment isn't needed?' Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer." <i><b>- Steve McConnell (Code Complete)</b></i></blockquote>
